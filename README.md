Arduino Powered LED Game 
========================

The code is designed to work with an Arduino Nano but it should be easy to modify for almost any Arduino Board! You can download all of the files for use in Platformio, just download to your Projects folder. If you want to use it with the Arduino app then just copy the code in the '[src](https://github.com/masonhorder/arduino-powered-led-game/blob/master/src/main.cpp)' file
